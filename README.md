## LSD-SLAM fork

So this repo contains bits and pieces of my LSD-SLAM research.
In 2016 I made the noros buid and after it I compiled the code and the dependencies for arm(my LGG3 phone).
However the results were quite unsatisfactory as SD-SLAM requires global shutter cammera an other things to run properly.

If anyone is interested in the code I'll gladly work with them to make all this compile and produce a nice app, however for now this is just an archive of my research.
